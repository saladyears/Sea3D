Known Bugs as of 03-09-2002:
----------------------------

Binary .pbm files generated by PSP4 aren't generated correctly, or DevIL has
 problems loading them (I strongly believe it is the former, not the latter).

Some 1-bit .pcx files aren't loaded completely correctly.

None of the ilu filters operate on more than one plane of 3d images.

In MSVC++, the Cpp Wrapper project gives the following two warnings at link-
time:
ilu.lib(ilu.dll) : warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR already defined in OpenIL.lib(DevIL.dll); second definition ignored
ilut.lib(ilut.dll) : warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR already defined in OpenIL.lib(DevIL.dll); second definition ignored
These appear to be quite harmless, but they're annoying, nonetheless.

The blurring filters appear to move the image to the right after several
iterations.

iluRotate does not work properly on images with palettes yet.

libtiff does not load the alpha channels of some TIFF files.  For an
explanation of the bug, look at
 http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65

libgif loads some .gif animations incorrectly.

TIFF saving in Windows CE is slightly flawed, because libtiff works only with
char* filenames and not Unicode, so I have to use WideCharToMultiByte to get
the filename correct.

.tif, .png, .mng and .gif support are missing in the Windows CE version to
keep the library small.  They could be easily added back, though.

Some Big Endian support is missing, especially DDS.

Does not work correctly in Dev-C++ right now.
