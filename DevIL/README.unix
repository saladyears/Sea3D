Developer's Image Library version 1.3.0 Readme, Notes and Quick Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<DZA[afk]> DevIL song: "la la la, a cross-platform image library utilizing a
           simple syntax to load, save, convert, manipulate, filter and display
           a variety of images with ease, la la la"


What is it?
-----------

DevIL is an Open Source image library whose distribution is done under the
terms of the GNU LGPL license. See the COPYING file for more details.
DevIL offers you a simple way to implement loading, manipulating, filtering,
converting, displaying, saving from/to several different image formats in your
own project.


Where can I find it?
--------------------

DevIL can be found at http://www.imagelib.org and http://openil.sourceforge.net


How do I compile the 3 libraries ?
-----------------------------------------

Just type ./configure && make. It should find automatically what can
(or cannot) be built on your system.

NB : ./configure --help gives you all compiling options available for the three
      libs. This includes enabling/disabling picture formats, ilut apis.

More Extensive Documentation
----------------------------

This file is only a quick guide to point you to more detailed information on
how to use DevIL.  More extensive documentation can currently be found on the
DevIL site at http://www.imagelib.org and in the /Docs directory in a normal
install.


Why the hell another image library?
-----------------------------------

I have never seen an image library that can do everything DevIL does. Sure,
various different libraries can do part of what DevIL can do as well or even
better, but I wanted a simple to use library that encompassed all of these
features.  I also wanted an extremely portable image library that could be used
from a variety of languages and utilized the OpenGL syntax.


Basic Readme
------------

Most anything stated in this document applies to DevIL as well as DevILU and
DevILUT, unless otherwise stated. (This file is best viewed with word wrap on.)

Libraries needed to compile DevIL* :
-----------------------------------

They are all autodetected by the ./configure script. But if you want to include
one of those format, you have just to install the corresponding lib :

libjpeg available at 
libungif available at 
libtiff available at 

or in your distro/port ftp/site/whatever_you_want :-)

Errors:
-------

All errors generated inside DevIL, along with illegal parameters passed to
DevIL functions are caught and passed to ilSetError(), an internal library
function.  The calling program can call ilGetError() to get the value of the
error generated.  Error types are defined in il.h, using the 0x501 - 0x5FF
range.  ilGetError() will return 0 (IL_NO_ERROR) if no error has occurred.


Installation:
-------------

If #make succeeded, just type #make install


Usage:
------

As of right now, no function needs to be called to setup the library, as it is
all set up in DllMain() in Windows.  To load an image, simply:

#include <IL/il.h>
#include <IL/ilu.h>
#include <IL/ilut.h>


ILuint id, Error;

ilGenImages(1, &id);
ilBindImage(id);
ilLoadImage("default1.tga");  // Loads into the current bound image
Error = ilGetError();


Then you can do something with the image, such as sending it to OpenGL as a
texture:

ilutRenderer(IL_OPENGL);  // Switch the renderer
TexID = ilutGLBindTexImage();
Error = ilGetError();


Make sure to close the image when you are done with it (though DevIL
automatically deletes them when the program exits):

glDeleteTextures(1, &TexID);
ilDeleteImages(1, &id);


The TestIL project is included to test features of DevIL.

DevIL includes a project called GLTest.  This is a simple test of DevIL's
capabilities.  All it does it load any image and displays it in a window
created by FreeGlut, which is available on http://freeglut.sourceforge.net. It
is also included to let the user have an idea of what the library can really
be used for.

Several other test projects are included to test support with various display
APIs.  The WindowsTest project is a basic image program that only runs in
Windows right now but showcases several of DevIL's features through various
menus.

If you want more in-depth tutorials, you can find them on
http://www.imagelib.org, or they may be in your installation under the /tuts
directory.  Documents are also available in the /docs directory.


Additional Reading
------------------

All image formats used in DevIL have corresponding documents on
http://www.wotsit.org, under the Graphics Files section.  These documents
proved invaluable for the creation of this library when there was no library
already available for that image format.
