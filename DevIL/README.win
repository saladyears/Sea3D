Developer's Image Library version 1.3.0 Readme, Notes and Quick Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<DZA[afk]> DevIL song: "la la la, a cross-platform image library utilizing a
           simple syntax to load, save, convert, manipulate, filter and
           display a variety of images with ease, la la la"


What is it?
-----------

DevIL is an Open Source image library based on the LGPL license.  DevIL* is
capable of loading/manipulating/filtering/converting/displaying/saving from/to
several different image formats.


Where can I find it?
--------------------

DevIL can be found at http://www.imagelib.org and http://openil.sourceforge.net


Where do I find the projects files ?
-----------------------------------------

MSVC++ projects are in \DevIL\projects\MSVC.


More Extensive Documentation
----------------------------

This file is only a quick guide to point you to more detailed information on
how to use DevIL.  More extensive documentation can currently be found on the
DevIL site at http://www.imagelib.org and in the /Docs directory in a normal
install.


Why the hell another image library?
-----------------------------------

I have never seen an image library that can do everything DevIL does.  Sure,
various different libraries can do part of what DevIL can do as well or even
better, but I wanted a simple to use library that encompassed all of these
features.  I also wanted an extremely portable image library that could be used
from a variety of languages and utilized the OpenGL syntax.


Basic Readme
------------

Most anything stated in this document applies to DevIL as well as DevILU and
DevILUT, unless otherwise stated.


The IL_NO_XXX #define's:
------------------------

A user can recompile this library without complete image support in it.  For
example, if your project does not use .jpg files, you can uncomment
#define IL_NO_JPG at the top of il/il.h, recompile the library, and no .jpg
support will be added, meaning quicker compiles and a smaller library.


The ILUT_USE_XXX #define's:
---------------------------

To disable support for a specific API, edit IL/ilut.h and comment the
corresponding #define.  Per example, to disable OpenGL functions support,
 add // in front of the line that reads:

#define ILUT_USE_OPENGL


Libraries needed to compile DevIL* :
-----------------------------------

Libraries.txt (included with the DevIL distribution) lists all libraries needed
to properly compile DevIL.

Precompiled versions and sources of all libraries needed to compile DevIL are
available at http://openil.sourceforge.net/libs/LibCompiled.zip and
http://openil.sourceforge.net/libs/LibSrc.zip , respectively.


Errors:
-------

All errors generated inside DevIL, along with illegal parameters passed to
DevIL functions are caught and passed to ilSetError(), an internal library
function.  The calling program can call ilGetError() to get the value of the
error generated.  Error types are defined in il.h, using the 0x501 - 0x5FF
range.  ilGetError() will return 0 (IL_NO_ERROR) if no error has occurred.


Installation:
-------------

Just unzip and compile other libs included if needed...  You should be able to
just go to tools - options - directories and add in the include and lib
directories for DevIL.


Usage:
------

As of right now, no function needs to be called to setup the library, as it is
all set up in DllMain() in Windows.  To load an image, simply:

#include <IL/il.h>
#include <IL/ilu.h>
#include <IL/ilut.h>


ILuint id, Error;

ilGenImages(1, &id);
ilBindImage(id);
ilLoadImage("default1.tga");  // Loads into the current bound image
Error = ilGetError();


Then you can do something with the image, such as sending it to OpenGL as a
texture:

ilutRenderer(IL_OPENGL);  // Switch the renderer
TexID = ilutGLBindTexImage();
Error = ilGetError();


Make sure to close the image when you are done with it (though DevIL
automatically deletes them when the program exits):

glDeleteTextures(1, &TexID);
ilDeleteImages(1, &id);


The TestIL project is included to test features of DevIL.

DevIL includes a project called GLTest.  This is a simple test of DevIL's
capabilities.  All it does it load any image and displays it in a window
created by FreeGlut, which is available on http://freeglut.sourceforge.net.
It is also included to let the user have an idea of what the library can
really be used for.

Several other test projects are included to test support with various display
APIs.  The WindowsTest project is a basic image program that only runs in
Windows right now but showcases several of DevIL's features through various
menus.

If you want more in-depth tutorials, you can find them on
http://www.imagelib.org, or they may be in your installation under the
/examples directory.  Documents are also available in the /docs directory.


Additional Reading
------------------

All image formats used in DevIL have corresponding documents on
http://www.wotsit.org, under the Graphics Files section.  These documents
proved invaluable for the creation of this library when there was no library
already available for that image format.
