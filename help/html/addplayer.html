If you are planning on playing network games with this player, you may select your first and second choice colors for games as well as specify any languages that you speak to help other network players determine if they can communicate with you.
<P>
You may also register your player to play on the ladder at the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site, or, if you have already created a ladder player on another computer, you may download that player from the site to this computer.

If you want to register a new player to play on the ladder, click the I want to register... checkbox and then click the Register button to bring you to the <a href="conregister.html">Register a player</a> window.  You must have at least filled out a name or handle before Sea3D will allow you to continue.
