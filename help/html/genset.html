<P>
This window has several checkboxes to allow you to configure some basic, yet important, aspects of Sea3D.  The following options are available to you:
<H2><B>Play sounds</B></H2>
You must have downloaded the Sounds Add-on to actually hear anything, but Sea3D has a veritable cornucopia of ambient excellence for your aural satisfaction.  Get the sounds from the <a href=http://www.s3dconnector.net/download.php target="_blank">Sea3D Download</a> site in the Add-ons section.

<H2><B>Enable auto-trading</B></H2>
Sea3D can help you speed up your turns by automatically determining when trading with the bank would let
you do something more than your current cards allow by themselves.  For example, if you have 3 wheat, 1 timber, and a 3 for 1 port, Sea3D (with auto-trading turned on) will show you the road build picture and automatically trade the 3 wheat for 1 clay when you build it.  The number of yellow trade symbols in the build picture tells you how many trades with the bank you'll have to make to purchase that build option.  This speeds up the game tremendously.  But, if you enjoy stone-age living, you can turn it off and play without it.

<H2><B>Use European tiles and cards </B></H2>
You must have downloaded the European Cards and Tiles Add-on from the main website for this option to be enabled.  With this option turned on, all Sea3D tiles and cards will be the European versions.  If you're European, I highly recommend it.  Get the file from the <a href=http://www.s3dconnector.net/download.php target="_blank">Sea3D Download</a> site in the Add-ons section.

<H2><B>Use large fonts and pictures</B></H2>
This option increases the font size and picture size of the player, bank, and legend information for those of you who like to run Sea3D at insane resolutions.  For reference, running a game with 6 players and the bank in large fonts will fit into a 1024x768 screen resolution.

<H2><B>Animate Controls</B></H2>
Normally, the Control Panel and Roll windows slide in and out during Sea3D game play to hide or show when needed or not.  If this overpowers your graphics processor, or if your fast-twitch muscles have been so honed to perfection that you cannot abide the 1.8 seconds it takes the buttons to slide out, you can turn off the animations with this setting.  If turned off, the windows will simply appear and disappear at the appropriate times.

<H2><B>Show splash screen</B></H2>
By default, Sea3D starts by showing you the <a href="splash.html">splash screen</a> where
you can choose from various options to get right into playing the game.  However, if you
would rather have Sea3D start in the <a href="main.html">main window</a>, uncheck this
option.

<H2><B>Hotseat: Automatically roll on your turn </B></H2>
If you enjoy your fast paced life so much that you must have <i>everything</i> fast, you can turn this option on to automatically roll for you on your turn and save you that one extra click.  Think of the time saved!  Precious milliseconds that would otherwise have been wasted!

<H2><B>Hotseat: Ask for next player after turn </B></H2>
When playing hotseat, depeding on who you play with, you may not trust the other person to not look at what's in your hand after ending their turn.  Turning this option on hides all player's hands after the End Turn button is clicked and brings up a box waiting for you to click OK to contine to the next player's turn.  This way, no one has a chance to see anyone else's hand.

<H2><B>Network: Embed chat window </B></H2>
If this is turned on, the chat window is embedded into the <a href="gl.html">main OpenGL window</a> and does not float above the screen.  If this option is turned off, the chat window becomes a floating version that you can move around the screen and place where you want.  The option is purely your own choice.  The actual chatting is not affected either way.  All keystrokes you type will go to the chat window entry you have showing, unless you have specifically clicked on another window.

<H2><B>Network: Automatically roll on your turn </B></H2>
Just like the hotseat version, this setting makes it so you automatically roll on your turn in network games (unless you have a card you can play).  Usually a wise decision in network games, lest you incur the wrath of your competitors for dawdling about without realizing that it is your turn to roll.

<H2><B>Network: Auto-reject trade timeout</B></H2>
This sets the delay, in seconds, after receiving a trade offer before Sea3D automatically rejects the trade for you.  The default is 15 seconds.  If this is too short or long for you, you can change the setting to anywhere between 1 and 30 seconds.  This option affects network play only.
