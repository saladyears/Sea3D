<P>
Registering a player to play on the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> ladder is a two-step process.  First, when you click on the Register button in the <a href="addplayer.html">Add a player</a> screen, Sea3D checks the site to make sure that your name is unique.  If it already exists on the site, you will have to select another one.
<p>
Once you have gotten a unique name, Sea3D requires that you enter a password and confirm it to make sure that your player is secure.  Sea3D will not allow you to enter a blank password.  It is important to remember this password because once you have completed 10 games on the ladder, your login name and password will be automatically registered on the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net/phpBB" target="_blank">forums</a> and you will be able to post bug reports, feature requests, and join in the online community.
