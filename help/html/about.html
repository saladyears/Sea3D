<P>
This window displays the current Sea3D version and the rotating cube of fame with credits for all the people that have helped to make Sea3D what it is.  If you've given suggestions about Sea3D in the past, look for your name on it.  If you have, and you're not there, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:jfugate@settlers3d.net">jfugate@settlers3d.net</a> and I'll take care of it.
