<P>
In this window, Sea3D displays a list of incomplete games stored in its database.  If you want to continue playing a saved game, select the game from the list and click the Open button. If it was a hotseat game, Sea3D completely restores the game file and the <A HREF = "gl.html"> main OpenGL window</A> to the state of the game when it was saved.  Play continues from that point on.
<p>
If it was a network game, Sea3D brings up the <a href="host.html">Host a network game</a> window so that everyone else in the game can reconnect to it before continuing.
<P>
Once you select a game from the list, you can also click the Delete button to remove the game from the database.  You were probably losing, anyway.
