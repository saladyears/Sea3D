<P>
If you clicked on the Jump to Main Window option in the startup splash screen, this is window you see.  You will also see this window if you quit a Sea3D game without quitting the application.  You have several options available to you, described in the following paragraphs.

<H2><B>File->New (Ctrl+N)</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="gametype.html>What do you want to do?</A>
window, the first step on the path to a new Sea3D game, where you select which type of Sea3D game you want to play.

<H2><B>File->Open (Ctrl + O)</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="opengame.html">Select a game to open</a> window, which allows you to continue playing a saved Sea3D game.

<H2><B>File->Take Tour</B></H2>
This starts off the tour through Sea3D that covers creating a hotseat game, selecting a map, adding players, and the basics of the OpenGL window and toolbars.  If you've never done anything with Sea3D before, this is a good way to start.

<H2><B>File->Exit (Alt+F4)</B></H2>
Amazingly, selecting the exit button causes Sea3D to exit.  If you have a game currently open, Sea3D will ask you if you are sure you want to exit.  If you say yes, the OpenGL window will close and all your game data will be lost if you haven't saved it.

<H2><B>Databases->Players </B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="dbplayers.html">Player Database</A> window which maintains a record of all players in your Sea3D player database.

<H2><B>Databases->Game</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="dbgames.html">Game Database</A> window where you can see a list of all completed games in your database.  

<H2><B>Databases->Maps</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="dbmaps.html">Map Database</A> window where available maps are listed.

<H2><B>Options->General</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="genset.html">General Settings</A> window where you can configure Sea3D to your liking.

<H2><B>View->Toolbar</B></H2>
Shows or hides the main window toolbar, which has various self-explanatory shortcuts on it.  All the toolbar shortcuts correspond to menu options presented on this page.

<H2><B>Help->Help (F1)</B></H2>
Opens this help system.  You may press F1 in any screen to get help.

<H2><B>Help->About</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="about.html">About</A> window with the rotating cube of fame!
