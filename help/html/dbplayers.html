<H1>Player Database</H1>
<img src=graphics\dbplayers.jpg>
<P>
This window contains a list of all players currently stored
in the Sea3D Player Database, along with a few stats for each player.   Players that were created on your computer are displayed in white and players that were created on other computers are displayed in gray.  You may only play Sea3D games with players that have been created on your computer.  Any player with a ladder icon in the first column indicates that that player has been registered to play on the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> ladder.
<p>
You have the following options available to you:
<H2><B>Add</B></H2>
The Add button opens the <A HREF="addplayer.html">Add a player</A> window where player name and color preferences (used in network games) can be configured as well as controlling how you register or download ladder players from the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site.

<H2><B>Edit</B></H2>
Once a player's name has been selected in the Player Database window,
the Edit button becomes available.  The Edit button
opens the <A HREF="addplayer.html">Add a player</A> window in edit mode so that player name and color preferences can be altered according to your will as well as registering or downloading a player from the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> ladder.

<H2><B>Delete</B></H2>
The Delete button is a useful way to delete an unsightly player from your database.  Click on it, and Sea3D will give you one more chance to reconsider before purging the offending player from the Player Database forever.  Note, however, that all games that you have played have player information stored in them and choosing to import players from the game database will populate your player database with every player you have every played against.  You've been warned.

<H2><B>Import from game data</B></H2>
Player information may also be imported from other games already in the game database by using the Import from game data button.  This allows you to see the stats associated with that player and determine a list of players that you have played against.  However, any imported players will be greyed out to indicate that they were not created with your Sea3D game and cannot be used by your Sea3D game in any network games.  This is to prevent you from assuming the identity of someone else and going on an Sea3D rampage with their name.  Identity theft is a serious crime.
