<P>
Sea3D uses port 7176 by default, but if players need to use an alternate port
the Network Port window can be used to set the value of the TCP/IP port that Sea3D listens on.
All players intending to be in the same network game must use the same
TCP/IP port or they will not connect to the server.  If you have problems establishing a connection, double check the current port used by Sea3D.
