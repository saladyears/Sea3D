<H1>Game Database</H1>
<img src=graphics\dbgames.jpg>
<P>
This window contains a list of all games currently stored
in the Sea3D Game Database.   You have the following options available to you:
<H2><B>Open</B></H2>
The Open button creates the <A HREF="gl.html">main OpenGL window</A> showing the final state of the board at the end of the game.  By opening a game, you can look at all of its stats and game history, allowing you to sigh fondly as you relive your greatest victories.

<H2><B>Delete</B></H2>
Pressing this button completely removes a game from your Game Database.  All player information contained within the game will also be lost.

<H2><B>Export</B></H2>
If you select one or many games from the list, the Export button will become available.  By clicking this button, you can specify a file into which Sea3D will create a backup of all of the games you selected.  The default extension for this file is ".s3d".  You can easily create a backup of your entire S3D Game Database this way, or you could send an exported game file to a friend and they could import the games in the file into their own Game Database.  Conceivably, one could create a massive database of Sea3D games in this manner.

<H2><B>Import</B></H2>
The Import button is the converse of the Export button and allows you to import games from a file into your Game Database.  You can use this to recover from a catastrophic loss of data on your computer (because getting all this Sea3D games will probably be your highest priority!).  You can also use this feature to import games from someone else's game database that they have exported to a file.

<H2><B>Repost</B></H2>
The Repost button is only enabled if you select a game that was played on the ladder.  Occasionally, there are problems with the ladder game data when it is posted to the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site.  By clicking this button, Sea3D will query the site for all of the data in that game, and if any is missing it will repost that data to the site.  This ensures that you will get the proper points for the ladder game you played in.
