<P>
In this window, Sea3D lets you steal a card from a player after you have put the robber on a tile that the player has a city or settlement on.  The names of all players bordering the tile will be in the list at the bottom of the window.  If a player does not have any cards to steal, their name will not be in the list.
<P>
Select a player to steal a card from by clicking on their name in the list.  You may change players at any time by clicking on someone else's name.  However, once you have selected a card from someone's hand, you cannot then select another player to steal from, because that would be cheating.
<P>
In a hotseat game, all cards from the player you select start out not visible (shown as the back of the card).  You may select a card from that player by clicking one of the card backs in the list.  Sea3D will randomly choose for you and show you what you got in the top of the window.  You may then press OK to continue.  Alternately, if you want to work out a deal with the player you are stealing from where they "give" you a card that you negotiate, you may click the Show cards box and all the player's cards will become visible, allowing you to select the card you have arranged upon.  The Show cards box is only visible in hotseat mode.
<P>
In network mode, all cards from the player you select are always shown as the back of the card.  You select a card from that player by clicking one of the card backs in the list.  Sea3D randomly chooses a card from the player's hand for you and shows you what you got in the top of the window.  You must then press OK to continue.
