<P>
This window allows you to connect your Sea3D application to a server hosting the network game.  Since someone else is hosting the network game, you must enter the TCP/IP address of the host computer into the TCP/IP Address box.  If you know the explicit IP address, maybe gotten in an email or via instant messenging system, and you can copy the address and directly paste it into your TCP/IP Address box using the Ctrl-V key combination.
<p>
However, the easiest way to connect to a game is to click on the Find Games button to bring up the <a href="connector.html">Connector</a> window.  This built-in game finder allows hosts to post their game to the Internet and clients everywhere around the world to see them and connect.  The Connector handles everything for you.  You just select game you want to play in, click it, and it enter the IP address and any other information and connects.
<P>
The Advanced button brings up the <A HREF="netport.html#Network Port">Network Port</A> window, where you can specify an alternate network port to use, but you usually should not have to use this.
<P>
Once you have connected to a certain address, the >> button can be used in later games to give you a list of the 5 most recent addresses you have connected to.  Simply click on it and connect the address you would like to connect to.  This is a great way to reconnect to a game you were disconnected from right away without having to find it in the list of Connector games.
<P>
Once you've entered the TCP/IP address, click on the Connect button.  Sea3D will attempt to contact the host at the given address.  If successful, messages will appear in the <A HREF="chat.html">Chat</A> window indicating success.  If unsuccessful, Sea3D will timeout and inform you that it was unable to connect to the host and give you information regarding its failure.  If you used the Connector, you won't have to click the Connect button.  Sea3D will try to connect automatically.
<P>
When everyone has connected to the host computer, the host player will start the game!  At that point, you will be on to the <A HREF="startsel.html#Starting position selection">Starting position selection</A> window and the game will be underway.
