<P>
If you have created a ladder player that is registered on the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site and would like to use that player in another Sea3D application other than the one you created the name with, you will need to download that player to your current Sea3D application.
<p>
To download the player, simply enter in the name of the player you want to download from the site and click the Download button.  The <a href="conpassword.html">Player Download Password</a> window will appear asking you to verify the password of the player you are downloading.  If entered properly, you will have downloaded the ladder player to the Sea3D application you are running and will be able to play ladder games from that location.
<P>
NOTE: If you do not delete the ladder player using the <a href="dbplayers.html">Player Database</a> from that computer before leaving, anyone will be able to play on the ladder as your player.
