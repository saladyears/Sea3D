<P>
This window exists to allow you to choose which type of Sea3D game you want to play.  There are two options:
<H2><B>Play a hotseat Sea3D game</B></H1>
This mode allows you to play a game of Sea3D with several players sitting at the same computer.  Sea3D creates the board, randomly sorts the players you give it, and runs the game for you.  All you do is tell Sea3D what you want to do on your turn.  Sea3D displays your hand (and
possible turn actions) only during your turn, and your hand cannot
be arbitrarily modified (imagine the rioting and looting if you could do that).  Sea3D keeps track of game history, statistics, and ends the game when someone wins.
<P>
The next step in playing a hotseat game is to select the map you want to play in the approriately named <A HREF="mapsel.html#Select a map to play">Select a map to play</A> window.

<H2><B>Play a network Sea3D game</B></H1>
This mode is the same as hotseat in almost every way, except that each player is sitting at their own computer and you play on a network or over the Internet.  At the start of a network game, you tell Sea3D if your computer is hosting the game or if you are trying to connect to another computer.  If you are hosting the game, you get to select which map and variants you are going to play with.  You also have the power to boot any player from the game before starting.  Your power is unlimited!  In network mode, Sea3D has a single chat window for all players which broadcasts
messages to each player when events occur that change the map or
players hands.
<P>
By using the Connector, which is Sea3D's built-in game-finder, you can find a game on the Internet to play in almost no time at all.  You will want to make sure that you have registered your player to play on the ladder, as most Connector games are ladder games.
<p>
The next step in playing a network game is to choose which player you will play in the <A HREF="network.html#Choose your player and connect option">Choose your player and connect option</A>
window.
