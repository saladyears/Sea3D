<P>
In this window, Sea3D allows you to trade cards between the current player and other players in hotseat games.
<P>
The current player's name and cards are shown on the left side of the screen.  On the right side is a list of other players that the current player may trade with.  Select one of the players in the list by clicking on their name.  The cards in their hand will be shown above the list of players.
<P>
Clicking on any of the current player's cards adds that card to the current trade offer at the top of the screen.  Clicking more than once on a card continues to add that card to the trade offer.  The same rules apply to adding cards from other players.  Once the trade is agreed upon by both parties, you execute the trade by clicking the Trade button at the top of the screen.  A trade is not executed until this button is pressed!
<P>
If the zero card trade variant is being played, the Trade button
at the top of the screen is enabled when any card is in
the trade box.  Otherwise, the button is only enabled when resources from both player's hands have been moved into the trade box.
<P>
The current player may trade as many times as he or she wants and
with whomever he wants.  There is no limit other than the patience of the other players.
