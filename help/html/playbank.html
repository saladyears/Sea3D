<H1>Player and Bank Buttons</H1>
<img src=graphics\players.jpg>
<P>
These windows on the left side of the screen give you information on each player and the bank.

<H2><B>Player Buttons</B></H1>
Each player button is outlined by the color of the player it represents.  If someone is red on the game map, they have the red player button and vice versa.  The player's name is always listed in the upper-left of the button.  
<P>
NOTE: The player whose turn it is will have a darker strip in their color bar on the left side of the player button.
<P>
Goods and Development Cards: The largest part of the player button is devoted to displaying the player's current amounts of resource and development cards.  There is a picture representing each type of resource and a number underneath it telling how many of that resource the player has.  If a resource does not appear, the player does not have any of it.  In network games, you may only see resources for yourself (unless you have a special variant turned on).  This prevents you from cheating.  In hotseat games, only the resources for the current player are displayed.
<P>
NOTE: If you want to see which development cards you have, move the mouse on top of the development card picture.  Text will pop up telling you exactly which cards you have.
<P>
NOTE: If a player is in danger of losing cards on a 7 roll because they have too many cards, all the numbers under their goods will be colored red.  Otherwise, they will be colored white.
<P>
Stock amounts: Next to the goods area on the right in its own column, is information on how many stock items a player has remaining.  This is always visible to all players no matter what mode you are playing in.  From top to bottom, the pictures represent the roads, settlements, and cities, and the numbers to the right tell you how many of each the player has available to play.  In Seafarers maps, the area is expanded and also shows how many ships are left.  Remember that once a player plays a road, ship, or city it is removed from their stock for the rest of the game, but a player can get back settlements when they replace them with a city.
<P>
Points, army size, and road length: In the far right of the player button is the most important information about that player - how many points they have!  The number next to the smiley face tells you how many points the player has.  If the number is colored red, the player is currently winning or tied for the lead.  If it is white, they are losing.
<P>
Once a user plays a soldier card, an army card picture appears below the smiley face.  The number to the right of the soldier card tells you how many soldiers the player has played.  If the number is colored red, the player has the Largest Army (and 2 more points).  If it is white, the player does not have the Largest Army.
<P>
Below the army card picture is a picture of one of the player's roads with a number to the right giving the length of the player's longest road segment.  If the number is colored red, the player has the Longest Road (and 2 more points).
<P>
NOTE: If you have the  Auto-hide player buttons option turned on, only the points, army size, and road length section of the player button will be visible.  To make the rest of the player button visible, simply move your mouse on top of it.  To then hide it again, move your mouse off of it.

<H2><B>Bank Button</B></H1>
The bank button gives you a visual indication of how many cards are left in the bank, just like playing the actual boardgame.  As cards are removed or added back to the bank, the pictures show a corresponding shrinkage or growth in the level of cards.  This gives you a good indicator which resource it's time to raid with the Monopoly card!
<P>
NOTE: If you have the Auto-hide player buttons option turned on, the bank will hide itself to allow more room on the screen for the OpenGL map.  To make the bank visible again, simply move your mouse on top of it.  To then hide it again, move your mouse off of it.
