<H1>Host a network game</H1>

<P>
This window allows you to configure and manage the network game that you are hosting.  The most important part of this window is on the first line: The TCP/IP Address of your computer that others must connect to in order to play.  All the players who want to join to your network game need this information to find your computer on the internet.  Fortunately, by posting your game on the Connector, it is all taken care of for you.  At the very least, you will have to select a map before being able to start a game.  The following buttons set up the game:
<H2><B>Use Connector</B></H2>
The magic button.  Clicking this button opens the <A HREF="consetup.html">Sea3D Connector Setup</A>
window that allows you to configure how your game will be presented on the Connector so that others from around the world may join, including the option to make it a ladder game or not.  The Use Connector button does not become enabled until you select a map to play first.

<H2><B>Advanced</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="netport.html">Network Port</A>
window that dispays the port that Sea3D listens on for other players.  All players have to use the same port number, which by
default is 7176.  Firewalls must let traffic come through on this port unless you have set up port forwarding.

<H2><B>Boot player</B></H2>
Because you are hosting the game, you have the ultimate power and can prohibit anyone from playing by disconnecting them at will with this button.  Highlight the name of the player in the list that you want to boot and click the Boot player button to disconnect them.  Their name will no longer be
in the list of players because they will have been terminated from the game.

<H2><B>Select map</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="mapsel.html">Select a map to play</A> window so that you can pick what map you'll use for your game.
When you've selected the map, information about the map appears in
the small box on the right of this window.
<P>
Once you've selected the map both the Start game! and the Variants
buttons will be active.   You still need to wait until all the other players have connect before clicking the Start game! Button.

<H2><B>Variants</B></H2>
Opens the <A HREF="variants.html">Variants</A> window
where you can customize game play in typical fashions that your group
of players agree are acceptable deviations from the rules.  You can
discuss what variants you'll use in the Chat window before you click
the Start game! Button.

<H2><B>Chat Window and Send</B></H2>
Once your players are connected to your hosting computer and appear
in the list, you can use the Chat window to type soothing messages to them
confirming that they've connected.  Type your message in the bottom
line at the bottom of the window and click the Send button or Enter on the keyboard.

<H2><B>Start game!</B></H2>
Once you select a map, you can start a game (even if you're all by yourself) by clicking the Start game! Button.  At this point, Sea3D will send all map, game, and player information to all connected players, and the map appears on the screen with dots at every hex corner. You've just started the game!  Now you're on to the <A HREF="startsel.html">Starting position selection</A>
window to get the game going.
<P>
If your players have problems finding your hosting computer from the internet, firewalls could be preventing them from finding your hosting computer.  Also check to make sure that the IP address displayed in this Window does not start with 192.168. or 10.0. since these are commonly used unroutable IP address used behind firewalls.  Only
people behind the firewall can see these addresses, which is great for playing network games, but lousy for playing internet games.  The only way having an IP address like this will work is if you have port forwarding set up on your router, but that topic is beyond the scope of these help files.
