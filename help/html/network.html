<P>
To participate in a network game, you have to figure out if you are hosting the game or trying to connect to it.  The following radio buttons in the Network Options box determine what role you will play in setting up your network game:
<H2><B>Host the network game</B></H2>
Hosting a network game requires that your computer not be hidden
behind a firewall.  If you are playing in a network game for the first time, you probably want to let someone else host the network game until you learn more about IP addresses, firewalls and what ports are used by Sea3D. 

<H2><B>Connect to the network game</B></H2>
Connecting to a network game puts the burden of setting everything up on to someone else.  Most players will use this setting, simply because only one player in a game can host it.
<P>
Using the Connector, it is very easy to find games to join and play in.

<H2><B>Player selection</B></H2>
Sea3D lists all the players in your database that are available for you to play a network game.  You must select a player and assign preferred colors (if you haven't already) before continuing on.
<P>
If you select to host a game, you will continue on to the <A HREF="host.html">Host a network game</A> window where you will be able to set up AI players, variants, and the maps, and wait for other players to join your game.
<P>
If you are connecting to a game, the <A HREF="connect.html">Connect to a network game</A>
window is the next one you will see, where you connect to the host that you specify.
