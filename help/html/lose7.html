<H1>Lose cards because of a 7</H1>

<P>
This window allows you to select the cards you must lose when someone rolls a 7 and you have too many cards.  To lose cards, you must first select your name from the list at the bottom of the screen.  Just click on your name in the list and it will highlight in blue and fill in the rest of the window with your information.
<P>
One card of every type in your hand appears in the window, and you may click on any card to discard that kind of card.  Clicking a card several times tells Sea3D that you are discarding more of that type of card from your hand.  Text on the right of the window tells you exactly how many cards you have to lose, and how many you've selected to lose up until now.
<P>
In this example, Jason Fugate has to lose a total of 6 cards, because he was well over the limit.  If he wanted to discard 3 timber and 3 wheat, he would click on the Timber card 3 times and the Wheat card 3 times.  Once you have selected enough cards to discard, Sea3D prevents you from selecting any more.  (We wouldn't want you losing too many cards, would we?)
<P>
If you decide to change your mind about which cards you want to lose, you can click on the cards you have already selected to lose and they will move back down to the original list.
<P>
In hotseat games, a list of all players who have to discard cards appears at the bottom of the window, and you must select all cards lost for all players before you can continue.  Select a player to lose cards for by clicking their name in the list.  Then repeat the process as usual.  Once all players have selected the cards they will lose, the OK button becomes enabled and you can continue.
<p>
In network games, only your name will appear in the list, and you must click on your name to begin losing cards.
