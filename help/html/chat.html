<H1>Chat Window</H1>

<P>
This window allows you to send and receive messages from other players and from the server during the game.  At anytime while playing a network game, typing text (from anywhere in the game) and pressing the Send Button (or Enter on the keyboard) causes the text to be sent to all other players.  Your messages and other player's messages are all
displayed in the left side box above the line where your text goes.  All system and game messages are displayed in the right side box.  There is no way to send private messages to anyone, because that would be cheating.
<p>
If you intentionally set the focus to another window (like a trade offer window) by clicking on it specifically, your text typed will not go to the chat window, but it will return once you close the other window.
<p>
By default, the chat window is embedded into the <a href="gl.html">main OpenGL window</a>.  However, by turning this off in the <a href="genset.html">General Settings</a> window, you can bring up the floating chat window described here.  It is purely a matter of your preference however you decide to do it.
