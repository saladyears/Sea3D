<P>
The Connector is the built-in game finder within Sea3D.  Any host that has created a game and wants players to join will have their game show up in this window for anyone around the world to join in.
<p>
Each game appears in its own row and the columns give you information about each game, including the host's Sea3D version, game name, host name, current map, current number of players, and IP and port information.  The first column also displays, in picture format, whether the game is a ladder game, private, and/or a restarted game.
<p>
By clicking on one of the games, the Players list on the right side will update to show who has joined the game.  Once you have selected a game, you can click the OK button and the Connector will attempt to join you automatically to that game.
<p>
Some games may be private, in which you will have to enter the correct password before you are allowed to join the game.
<p>
Clicking the Refresh button updates the list with any changes that have occurred since you last refreshed it.  If a game starts, it will disappear from the list, as you can no longer join it.  If a new game appears, you will hear a sound (if you have the Sounds add-on), indicating there is a new game.  This way, you can leave the Connector open while you surf the Internet and come back to it when you hear the sound play, indicating a new game.
<p>
You may also choose to have the Connector auto-refresh every 30, 60, or 90 seconds by selecting any of the radio buttons at the bottom.
