<P>
This is the <A HREF="gl.html">main OpenGL window</A> in the state in which it appears at the very start of the game with the map generated by Sea3D in glorious detail.
<P>
On the map you will see dots of the same color
at each of the corners of the hexes.  The color of all the
dots is the color of the first player to place a settlement,
and the dots indicate all the possible places that the
settlement could go.  All the players are listed on the left of the screen, in the order in which they play.
<P>
The first player places his or her first settlement by clicking on any colored dot desired.  After placing the settlement, three lines between the hexes appear starting from the corner of the hex where the settlement was placed.  Clicking on or near one of these lines places the road that leads away from
the settlement.
<P>
At this point most of the dots on the maps at the corners of
the hexes are replaced with dots of the next player to place
a settlement.  That player does the same things to place their
settlement and road.  Notice that some of the hex corners do
not have a dot with the next player's color.  Players cannot
place settlements on corners of hexes adjacent to any previously
placed settlement.   So as each player puts down settlements, less and less dots will appear at corners of hexes indicating that there are less places available for building.  But why I am telling you this, since you know the rules already?
<P>
When the last player has place his or her last settlement on the
map, a message appears in the upper right of the screen in the 
<A HREF="gameplay.html">Control Panel</A>
indicating which player's turn it is and says "Click to roll".  You are ready to begin play!
