<P>
This window lets you pick the map you want to play your Sea3D game on.  From the map you select, Sea3D knows how many of each kind of resource tiles there are, what roll chips are available, and if there are any restrictions on where anything can be placed.  The map you select also tells Sea3D about the development cards, number of bank resources, and any special rules related to different scenarios.
<P>
In almost all types of games, Sea3D randomly creates the actual board based on the map you have selected.  However, some Seafarers maps have specific settings of roll chips and tiles that are static.
<P>
Maps for 3-4 player games and 5-6 player games are available for all Standard Settlers and Seafarers scenarios described in the book.
<P>
If you are playing in a hotseat game, the next step is to tell Sea3D who is playing in your game in the <A HREF="playsel.html#Select the players in your game">Select the players in your game</A> window.
