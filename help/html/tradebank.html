<P>
In this window, Sea3D allows you to manually trade your precious, hard earned resources into the bank for other resources.  The Trade with the bank window has a similar format to the rest of the trade windows, but the trade-in requirement for a resource is listed below each type of resource in your hand.  
<P>
If you have enough of a resource so that you can trade it in to the bank,
the trade-in requirement is displayed in green and the you can click that resource to move it into the trade box at the top of the window.  You can then click any resource from the bank to move it into the trade box and enable the Trade button.  By clicking the Trade button you execute the trade to the bank.  Sea3D automatically reduces your hand by the trade-in amount of the resource you traded and increments the new resource you bought.  You can trade-in as many resources at once for as many new resources as possible.
