<P>
This window allows you to see stats about the current game and is one of the coolest feature of Sea3D.  Not only do you get to see stats, but they are all updated in real-time, so you can constantly check to see how things are progressing.
<P>
On the left is a navigation bar so you can easily jump from stat to stat.  Just click on the plus or minus symbols to show or hide branches of game statistics.  Then click on any individual statistic to immediately jump to that part of the report.  The statistics summarize things like the frequency of dice rolls, the elapsed time or each player's turn, resources gained/lost and all information about trades and are all color coded to match the colors of the players.  Felt like you were getting picked on a lot?  Now you can prove it by looking at the stats and seeing that you DID lose 24 ore that game to the robber.
