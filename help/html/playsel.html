<P>
This window allows you to tell Sea3D what players you want to play with in your hotseat game.  Sea3D stores information about all players in its database and all of the players available to you from the database appear in the list on the left.  By double-clicking a player name in the list, you will assign that player to the next available color box (which, incredibly, assigns that player to that color).  You may also click and drag players
from the list to specific color boxes, or click and drag players from one color box to another, giving you several ways to achieve colorful happiness with all of your players.
<P>
There are two extra buttons in the window.  One allows you to quickly add (but not delete) a player to the database.  The second allows you to select a variant of the game to play.
<H2><B>Add player</B></H2>
Opens the <a href="addplayer.html">Add a player</a> window where the new player's name, color preferences and ladder status are entered. The player then appears in the list and can be selected by double-clicking or clicking and dragging to a color box on the right side of the window.

<H2><B>Variants</B></H2>
Opens the
<A HREF="variants.html#Variants">Variants</A> window where
you can configure some pretty crazy rules and extra options to the basic game.
<P>
Now you are done with all this setup stuff!  It's time to play!  Move on to the <A HREF="startsel.html">Starting position selection</A> window to see how to get things going.
