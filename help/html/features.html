<H1>Unique features of Sea3D</H1>
<P>
<H2><B>Auto-trading</B></H2>
Never before seen in the history of online boardgames!  Auto-trading lets you completely bypass trading with the bank by showing you pictures of everything you <i>could</i> build with the cards you have in your hand.  Have 5 timber, 2 wheat, and 2 ore?  Sea3D shows you a road (1 timber, 4 timber for 1 clay) and a city (2 wheat, 2 ore, 4 timber for 1 ore).  Just click on the picture to automatically trade with the bank and build the item.  Impress your friends, enrage your enemies!  Auto-trading is where it's at!

<H2><B>OpenGL 3D graphics</B></H2>
Spinning cubes, rotating, zooming, panning pixels with 24-bit high resolution textures and 3D models in ultra-fast OpenGL rendering.  Sound like the latest Quake or UT clone?  Nope it's Sea3D.  Sea3D uses hardcore OpenGL to draw its game board, and it looks good.  (Comes in <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net/download.php" target="_blank">European</a> flavor, too!)

<H2><B><a href="connector.html">S3D Connector</a></B></H2>
Sea3D has built-in game finding software that allows you to connect to games being played around the world!  Any player can host a game, post it to the Connector, and have others from around the world join in immediately.  This makes finding Internet games to play in incredibly easy!

<H2><B>Built-in Ladder Ranking</B></H2>
Yes, that's right.  Unlike any other Catan game out there, Sea3D has a built-in ladder ranking system that is completely integrated with the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site.  By registering a player to play on the ladder and then playing in a ladder game, your name will show up on the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net/connector/s3dladderview.php" target="_blank">ladder ranking</a>.  If you like a little more competition to spice things up, this is the way to go!

<H2><B><A HREF="opengame.html">Save/Reload Games</A></B></H2>
Ever had that annoying situation where you're two turns from winning the game and then someone drops the connection?  Arrrgh!  With Sea3D, it's a thing of the past.  Sea3D automatically saves network games every turn, and you can reload right from where you left off and continue on in case someone drops.  Now you can know for certain if someone quit because they were losing or whether the evil Internet caused the problem.

<H2><B><A HREF="stats.html">Statistics</A></B></H2>
You know you're good.  You know people fear playing  you because you always win.  Well, now you can prove it.  Sea3D keeps track of all kinds of statistics for you, including how many games each player has won in how many tries.  Find out who stole the most from you last game (and secretly carry the grudge on!).  See who makes the best trades!  See who rolls the most 7's!  It's all possible with Sea3D.

<H2><B><A HREF="history.html">Game History</A></B></H2>
With Sea3D, at any point in the game, you can look back through every single event that happened during the game.  Every one.  Nothing escapes Saur... I mean, Sea3D's all-seeing eye.

<H2><B>Seafarers Maps</B></H2>
Sea3D has every Seafarers map with <i>all the special rules</i> included.  Even the ones with the crazy trade routes or the swapping of rolls.  No other online Catan game has it!

<H2><B><a href="legend.html">Legend</a></B></H2>
You're new.  You haven't played the game that much.  That's OK.  Your in luck.  Sea3D gives you a legend that tells you exactly how much everything costs.  Now you can play like a pro without having to ask anyone what it takes to build a road!

<H2><B>Initial Tour</B></H2>
Because Sea3D has so many great features that you don't want to miss, you can take a tour through the game to see all the possibilities.  The first time you run Sea3D (and then from File->Take Tour), you have the option to fire it up and take Sea3D for a test-drive.

<H2><B><A HREF="dbplayers.html">Player Database</A></B></H2>
Sea3D keeps track of every player that plays in your games.  It lets you add players, delete players, edit players, and see stats on who's good and who's not!

<H2><B><A HREF="dbgames.html">Game Database</A></B></H2>
Every time you finish a game in Sea3D, it gets added to the Game Database.  Savor your incredible victories by opening the game database, selecting your favorite past game, and reopening it to the last board position!  You can even look at all the stats and game history!  Sea3D also lets you import and export games from your database so you and your friends can create a massive database of all your exploits!

<H2><B><a href="variants.html">Variants</a></B></H2>
Sea3D supports a long (and growing) list of popular variants from the common  (no 7 rolls first round) to the crazy (can't see roll chips until everyone's placed!).  It even has new tiles like Volcanoes and Jungles!  If you're getting tired of playing the same game, spice it up with a variant or two!
