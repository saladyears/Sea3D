<H1>Variants</H1>
<img src=graphics\variants.jpg>
<P>
The Variants window is full of lots of check boxes and fields that allow you to make small, or large changes to how the game is played.  These changes in the rules are considered typical deviations in game play that many players have agreed to in the past, though some are less typical than others.  
<P>
<H2><B>Disallow trading between players</B></H2>
If you want to enforce a game where no trading is allowed between players, this option is for you.  It is not allowed for ladder games.

<H2><B>Allow trades for zero cards</B></H2>
Let's players give away cards to other players during the game.  So, on your turn, you can "trade" 1 clay to someone for nothing, in exchange for them "trading" you 1 timber on their turn for nothing in return.  This allows for some very creative deal-making.  It is not allowed for ladder games.

<H2><B>Allow trading after building</B></H2>
Let's players trade, then build, then trade again.  Usually, you can only trade before building and then not again afterwards, but this relaxes that rule.

<H2><B>Show all players cards at all times</B></H2>
This piece of wackiness actually lets you play a hotseat or network game with the ability to see what's in everyone's hand at all times.  For large network games with 5 or 6 players, this can speed up trading considerably since you can target your trades.  However, it does remove a lot of the mystery from the game.  It is not allowed for ladder games.

<H2><B>Allow x trade offers per round</B></H2>
Forces a cap on the number of trade offers a player can make per round.  It is only applicable in network games.

<P>
<H2><B>Make all rolls equal odds</B></H2>
This crazy variation makes all numbers equally likely to be rolled during the game.  Normally 2's and 12's are the least likely numbers to be rolled,
and 6's and 8's are the most likely to be rolled, but this turns everything on its head and makes 2's, 12's, 6's, 8's and every other number have the same chance of being rolled.

<H2><B>No 7's in the first x round(s)</B></H2>
Prevents 7's from being rolled in the first x number of rounds so the robber does not
appear to steal cards or block production during these critical early turns.  Having this option turned on can speed the game up considerably.  In ladder games, this value may only be set to 1.

<H2><B>On a 7, round lost cards up, not down</B></H2>
In some European rulesets, cards lost on a 7 are rounded up not down (e.g. if you had 13 cards, you'd lose 7 instead of 6).  This variation allows you to play that way.

<P>
<H2><B>Deserts / Volcanoes / Jungles</B></H2>
These settings control what tiles are used as deserts or in place of them in your game.  By selecting volcanoes or jungles, you will replace every desert tile in that game with the tile you specified.  Volcanoes erupt when rolled and have a 1 in 6 chance of destroying a city or settlement at a particular corner, but they can also give gold which can be traded in for any resource.  Jungles give special tokens towards buying development cards.  These tokens may be used as an ore, wheat, or sheep and are basically wild cards towards getting a development card.  (So if I had an ore, a sheep, and one discovery token, I could get a development card because the discovery token would count as my missing wheat.  Having 3 discovery tokens basically gives you a free development card.)

<p>
<H2><B>Stock amounts</B></H2>
With these values, you can control how many roads, ships, settlements, and cities each player starts off with.  Altering any of them is not allowed for ladder games.

<p>
<H2><B>Game Options</B></H2>
You may also alter the number of points to win and the allowed cards a player can have in their hand without worrying about losing half of them on a 7 roll.  Altering either of these values is not allowed for ladder games.

<H2><B>Special Build Phase for 5-6 Players</B></H2>
If you like the standard scenario described in the rulebook for playing with 5-6 players where each player has a chance to build after the current player has ended their turn, you may turn it on with this option.  This will slow the game down but it is here for you to enjoy if you like.

<H2><B>Use Tournament starting rules</B></H2>
Tournament starting rules lets you start the game much more quickly than normal.  With this variant turned on, the placements go settlement/road around once, then back with city/road, and then one more time from first to last to place a third road.  So each player starts with 3 points, a city, and two roads ready for a settlement to be built (if they're smart).

<p>
The following check boxes affect board options:
<H2><B>Only show roll chips after placements</B></H2>
This wild variation keeps the roll chips (those things that tell you how good the odds on a tile are) completely hidden until AFTER everyone has placed their initial settlements and roads.  Essentially, you have to completely guess which spots are going to be good or bad when you are placing your settlements, which, as you might ascertain, adds a lot of tension to the opening placements.  It is not allowed for ladder games.
