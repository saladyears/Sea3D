<P>
This window allows you to offer a trade to other players when playing a network game.  Whether they accept it or not is entirely up to them, and you can choose who you will trade with if more than one person accepts your offer.
<P>
On the left of the window are all of your cards.  Click a card to add it to the trade offer, shown at the top of the window.  If you change your mind about your offer, click the card at the top of the window to move it back to your hand.
<P>
On the right of the window are pictures of all the cards.   Click these cards to add them to your trade offer, specifying what you want from the players you are offering the trade to.  If you change your mind about what you want, click the card at the top of the window to remove it from the trade.
<P>
At the bottom of the window is a list of all other players that you could possibly trade with.  By default, all of the checkboxes to the left of their names are turned on.  By turning off a checkbox, you choose not to offer a trade to that person.  This way, you can choose to offer a trade only to the one person you may have made an agreement to trade with. 
<P>
When you have finalized your trade offer, click the Offer button at the top center of the window.  If the zero card trade variant is being played, the Offer button will become available as soon as any card is added to the deal.  Otherwise, it will not be available until at least one card is added to both sides of the deal.
<P>
Once you click the Offer button, the window expands downward and shows empty boxes that get filled with people's replies as they send them in.

<P>
Each player's response will be listed to the right of their name in the list of players.  In this example Rachel Fugate has accepted the trade (and not just because she's my wife!).  Other possibilities are for people to Reject the trade or to Counteroffer the trade.
<P>
If another player accepts or counteroffers your trade, you will see the deal they want in one of the boxes below the player list with text telling you how they have responded.  If you have have the ability to agree to their response, the Trade! button next to their deal is enabled.  YOU MUST CLICK A TRADE! BUTTON TO TRADE.  If you do not click a Trade! button, you will not actually trade with anyone.  Trade! buttons only become enabled after everyone has replied to your offer and if you actually have the cards they want from you.
<P>
Once you have traded (or not traded) with someone, you can restart the process by creating another trade deal and sending it out again.  You do not have to close the window and reopen it again, though you may do so if you want to.  You may make trade offers as many times as you want on your turn.  There is no limit, unless the host has set a limit during a network game.
