<P>
This window allows you to setup some options regarding the game you are posting to the Connector.  Because you are hosting the game, you can control these variables.
<P>
You should enter a name for your game in the text area to advertise it to players who might want to connect.
<P>
Directly below the name entry area is a checkbox allowing you to make your game a ladder game.  When a ladder game finishes, Sea3D updates the <a href="http://www.s3dconnector.net" target="_blank">S3D Connector</a> site directly and posts all of the game data to it.  The site then calculates the new ladder ranking for each player based on how well they did in the game.  Player's ladder ratings go up and down depending on how well they do.
<p>
The player you are hosting the game with must be a ladder player for this checkbox to be enabled.  Also, if you select this option, only other players registered on the ladder will be able to join your game, and you will not be able to play with every variant, though many are still available.
<P>
You may also make your game a private one, if you have a select group of friends that you want to play with.  By clicking the private checkbox, you can then enter a password that people using the Connector will have to enter before connecting to your game.
<P>
You may also specify a cap to the number of players that will be allowed to join your game.  This way, if you only want to have a 4 player game, once 4 players have joined, anyone else who tries to join will be blocked and will get a message saying that there were already enough people.  This way, you don't have to boot anyone.

If you click the Advanced button, the window expands to give you more control over how players connect to your game.  This button is only useful if you have port forwarding set up on your router and players need to connect to a different IP address than what Sea3D has determined is your own.  In the Advanced section, you can specify an alternate IP address and port and these values will be passed through the Connector to other players instead.
<p>
These values will stay persistent for each game that you host, unless you click the Advanced button again to hide the port forwarding area.
