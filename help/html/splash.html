<P>
This is the first window you see when you start up Sea3D.  It has several options for you to choose from.

<H2><B>Open a saved game</B></H2>
Clicking this button brings up the <a href="opengame.html">Select a game to open</a> window where you can reload a game that you were playing previously.
<p>
Any hotseat game can be reloaded this way, but you may only reload a network game if you are the host, and reloading it brings you to the <a href="host.html">Host a network game</a> window where you wait for others to rejoin your game.

<H2><B>Play hotseat</B></H2>
Clicking this button starts the process towards creating a hotseat game.  The first thing you will be asked to do is to select a map in the <a href="mapsel.html">Select a map to play</a> window.

<H2><B>Play network</B></H2>
This button starts the process of hosting or joining a network game.  The next screen you see is the <a href="network.html">Choose your player and connect option</a> window where you select which player and connection method you are going to use.

<H2><B>Take a Tour</B></H2>
Clicking this button starts of a tour through Sea3D that covers selecting a map, creating new players, starting a hotseat game, and some of the basic commands and interfaces of Sea3D.  It is a good way to start if you are running Sea3D for the first time.

<H2><B>Jump to main window</B></H2>
If you want to do some of the more behind-the-scenes activities like managing player and game databases, you can jump to the <a href="main.html">main window</a> with this button and start using the menu options immediately.

<H2><B>Read disclaimer</B></H2>
Clicking this button brings up the disclaimer text that you agreed to when you installed the game.
