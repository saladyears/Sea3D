<H1>Common Problems and Solutions</H1>
<P>
Sometimes, not everything works properly for you when you are playing Sea3D, usually related to graphics performance.  Below are some common issues that people have when playing the game.

This is perhaps the most common problem.  Fortunately, it is the most easily resolved.  Sea3D need to be run in 24-bit or 32-bit display mode and you are most likely running it in 16-bit mode.  To change this, go to your desktop, right-click, and select Properties.  Then go to the Settings tab, find the Colors box and select 24-bit or 32-bit color as your setting.  Click OK and then restart Sea3D.

If that doesn't fix it, try updating your graphics drivers for your computer.

The issue at work here is that Sea3D needs at least 24-bit color depth to properly do its depth testing (meaning, Sea3D needs 24-bit color depth to figure out which objects are closer to you than other objects).  If nothing works, you can still play the game, albeit in a very unusual way.  Because everything is out of whack, you actually have to click <i>under</i> the circle to cause it to get hit.  To verify this, rotate the board until you are looking at it from the side.  Then click and hold both mouse buttons and move the mouse up, causing the board to float upwards on the screen so you can actually see the underside of it.  Then click where you would want to place.  Voila!  The settlement is built.

This is almost always resolved by updating your graphics drivers to the latest version with OpenGL support.  Laptop graphics drivers are especially notorious for being flaky with OpenGL support.

I have only heard about this on Korean versions of Windows XP.  Unfortunately, there is no known fix for this problem.  The game is still playable, though, because the text above the cards lets you know what you are trading.
