<P>
This window contains a list of all maps currently stored
in the Sea3D Map Database.   The 'O' column specifies whether a map is an "official" map that shipped with the boardgame or one of the expansions.  You have the following options available to you:
<H2><B>Import</B></H2>
The Import button is greyed out and will be enabled in a future release of Cities3D, once the map editor is finished.

<H2><B>Export</B></H2>
The Export button is greyed out and will be enabled in a future release of Cities3D, once the map editor is finished.
