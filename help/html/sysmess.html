<P>
In this window, which is only available in network games, you can choose to receive or not receive specific kinds of messages from the server.  By default, all messages are turned on.
<P>
By checking or unchecking one of the checkboxes, you will either see or not see that type of message in the chat window.  So, if you uncheck the "Development Cards" box, you will no longer get messages that tell you when someone has bought or played a development card.  One could turn off all system messages and still see what was happening in the game by opening the <A HREF="history.html">Game History</A> window.
