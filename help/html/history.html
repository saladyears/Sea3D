This window shows you every event that has transpired in the game from the beginning of the game up until now.  As new events happen, they will be added to this window in real-time.
<P>
You can expand and collapse individual turns to see what took place on that turn by clicking on the plus or minus symbol next to that turn.  There are unique icons for every action possible.
