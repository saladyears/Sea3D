<P>
In this window, Sea3D shows you a list of development cards you have in  your hand.  If the text of the card is gray, it means that you cannot yet play the card (probably because you bought it on the current turn).  However, you can click on any card in the list, grayed or normal, to see a picture of the card and read what it can do.
<p>
Sea3D will automatically select the first playable card from your hand and highlight it for you.
<P>
You play a card by selecting it from the list and then pressing the Play Card button.  Many things can result from playing a card, and they won't be detailed
here.  The instructions on using the cards are on the card pictures, anyway, though, so you should be able to figure it out.
