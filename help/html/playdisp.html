<P>
This window allows you to customize the way the player and bank buttons appear on the left side of the screen.  You have the following options available to you:
<H2><B>Auto-hide player and bank displays</B></H2>
If you turn this on, each player button (and the bank button) will hide itself, showing only the number of points, army size, and road length for the player.  When you move the mouse over the button, it pops back out to the right and displays the full player information, remaining that way until you move the mouse back off.  This greatly increases the amount of visible space on the screen, especially if you are using large fonts.  No other options in this window become  available until you select this option.

<H2><B>Animate buttons</B></H2>
With this on, Sea3D will use some nifty animations to slide the buttons out and in when you move the mouse over and off.  Recommended only for faster computer systems.

<H2><B>Always show self in network games</B></H2>
Causes your player button to always remain fully visible while you're playing a network game.

<H2><B>Always show current player in hotseat games</B></H2>
If this is checked, the current player button in any hotseat games will always be fully visible.  If you turn animations on as well, the effect is really neat.

<H2><B>Always show bank</B></H2>
Overrides the auto-hide setting for the bank so that it always remains visible.
